# calculator
Certainly! Here's a description of the provided Python calculator code:

This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The calculator operates in a loop, repeatedly displaying a menu of options and accepting user input until the user chooses to quit the program. Here's how the calculator works:

1. When the program starts, it displays a menu of options, including:
   - "add" for addition
   - "subtract" for subtraction
   - "multiply" for multiplication
   - "divide" for division
   - "quit" to exit the program

2. The user is prompted to enter their choice by typing one of the options listed above.

3. Depending on the user's choice, the program will ask for two numbers (num1 and num2) on which to perform the selected operation.

4. If the user chooses addition, it will add num1 and num2 and display the result.
5. If the user chooses subtraction, it will subtract num2 from num1 and display the result.
6. If the user chooses multiplication, it will multiply num1 and num2 and display the result.
7. If the user chooses division, it will divide num1 by num2 and display the result. It also checks for division by zero and handles that case.

8. If the user enters an invalid option, the program will display "Invalid input."

9. After each operation, the program will return to the main menu, allowing the user to perform additional calculations or choose to quit.

10. To quit the calculator, the user can type "quit" at any time, and the program will exit the loop, ending the calculator.

The calculator provides a simple and interactive way to perform basic arithmetic calculations. Users can perform multiple calculations in succession and exit the program when they are done.
